# mt_image_viewer

Image Viewer written in C that uses multithreading to load large image in milliseconds

# Getting Started

### Building the App

Make sure you have [gcc](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) installed and added to system PATH.

Execute _auto_build_cmake.bat_ and it should automatically build your application.

Use the _image_viewer.exe_ to open very large PNG files.
